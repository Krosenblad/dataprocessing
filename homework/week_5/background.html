			I grew up in Sweden. In the same manner that Dutch people make fun of Belgians, us Swedes have a hate-love relationship with Norwegians. Our sense of self is grounded in the perception that Sweden is the heart of Scandinavia, and even if the Norwegians are richer and perform better than us in the winter olympics,<br><br>
			We. Are. Still. Better.
			<br><br> The story I want to tell with my data visualisations is an attempt to answer the question us scandinavians have been asking ourselves for years (without reaching a conclusive answer): <br> Which country is objectively the best?<br>All countries in Scandinavia are rich, so my focus was never to map the (very small) monetary differences. Instead, I was interested in the more human aspects: wellbeing, happiness, life-expectancy and unemployement. According to <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Narrative-InfoVis.pdf">Segel and Heer (2010)</a>, there are several ways for a narrator to lead their reader through a story. On a spectrum between author-driven and reader-driven data visualizations, I believe my visualisation follows the "Martini Glass Structure". This means that first, I take the reader by the hand and introduce my data and the way they can interact with it. This represents the stem of the glass. Once the reader has understood the possibilities with the data, the glass opens up, and the reader is free to interact with the datasets.

			Exploring my data, you can see that Norway scores the best on the Happy Planet Index, as well as having the highest average wellbeing. Damn it. However, you can see that their unemployement rate is higher than all the other countries in Scandinavia in 2014. (Someone is being affected by the decrease in oil prices...) Sweden scores surprisingly low on the Happy Planet Index. Our unemployement is low in 2014, and our life expectancy is as high as in Norway. Yet, I think if we want to conclude something from this visualisation, it is that Norwegians simply are a happier and more content than Swedes.
